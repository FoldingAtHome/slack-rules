Slack Guidelines
================

 1. Be civil

For Donors
----------

 1. Projects marked "beta" or using a project key are not guaranteed to receive accurate credit. Initially, projects may not recieve any credit at all.
 1. Please address your concerns with a particular project to the appropriate project series channel (e.g. if you are reporting a bad WU for project 9411, please post to channel #9400).
 1. Please note that this is a forum for beta testing and discussing technical issues about specific projects in realtime with the Pande Group. For more general inquiries, please refer to the [Folding Forum](https://foldingforum.org/). Those who abuse the Folding@home Slack (e.g. complain about points, PG, etc.) will be promptly banned.


For Project Managers
--------------------

 1. Under "What I Do" in your account profile, please make some reference to your group and organization.
 1. Create your channel in accordance with your assigned project series (e.g. if you own the 94XX series, please create a #9400 channel). This keeps communication organized, without the need for hundreds of different channels.
 1. Keep your "channel topic" up to date with active projects. Include `OS`, `core`, beta status, and `ProjectKey`.
 1. Keep the general "channel topic" up to date with your active projects. Include the same information as in #2. Conversely, if there are no projects to be tested, please indicate this and refer users to the `BETA` Forum.
 1. Assign a `ProjectKey` which will be uniquely associated with your project but isn't easy to guess. Must be an integer that does not start with `0`. For example, Nikola Tesla's birth date: `10071856`.
 1. When advancing a project to `BETA`, please give testers users at least a day's notice.
